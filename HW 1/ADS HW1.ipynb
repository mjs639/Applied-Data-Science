    "Please submit this assignment to the NYU Classes 'Assignments' section by 12:00pm on Monday, October 1, strictly labeling the assignments with the format **'ADS_HW1_(your net ID).ipynb'**. Be sure not to confuse Net ID (e.g. 'acs882') with N-number ('N166...'). This homework is here for you to better understand and practice the material; while you may discuss approaches to problems with your classmates (in fact, this is encouraged!), please ensure that all final code submitted is your own. You may reach out to the TA, Alex Shannon, at acs882@nyu.edu at anytime (he hangs out at CUSP a lot, so feel free to say hello). Additionally, Professor Savage will hold office hours on Mondays from 9am-12am; a location for this will be confirmed and communicated shortly."

    "You are staring out the window from the 13th story of CUSP, looking on as people bustle about Jay Street; some head to the subway, others wait in line for street food, and yet others seem to wander around aimlessly. You don't know or care about what they are doing or where they are going. The one thing that you do know for certain is that none of them were born on a leap-day (February 29th). You also have recently found a dataset on subway ridership in NYC in which people have self-reported their birthdays. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because you are a data scientist, you begin to wonder... 'What is the likelihood that any one of them shares my birthday?' Knowing that, due to a variety of reasons, real-life births are not evenly distributed throughout the year, you decide to dig into the dataset to see if you can uncover trends in what time of year people are born. The dataset, unfortunately is a little messy, due to a poor user-interface, but with a bit of cleaning, should be fine to use. Let's take a closer look at the 'births.csv' dataset."
